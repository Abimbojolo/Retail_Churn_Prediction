# CHURN PREDICTION TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER RETENTION IN GROCERY E-RETAILING


## Project Overview

This project aims to provide insight into customer churn challenges of an e-retailer by examining the various customer experiences and behaviour, seeking to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain meaningful insight into the grocery e-retail customer data.
 
## Data
The E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction dataset was obtained online from Ankit Verma (2021), Product at Ufaber Edutech Pvt Ltd with the permission of Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction 

## Findings
The following findings were obtained from the dataset
1. 30% of consumers who shop at the store rated their satisfaction a score of 3, indicating that they are either not very happy or just moderately satisfied with the services they receive from the business.
2. 2314 signifying 41% of the customer base prefers to make payment with their debit cards.
3. Longer-staying customers do not constitute the larger proportion of churners but the new ones meaning the higher the tenure the less likely it is to churn. This also can be interpreted as the longer the customer stays, the less likely the churn tendency.
4. A greater proportion of customers who filed complaints eventually churned.

One of the interesting findings is that e-retailers may identify customers who are about to leave or have already decided to go by looking at certain customer behaviour. 

## Methods
Python programming was used to investigate this dataset

SQL was used to query data and analyse

Power BI was utilised to explore relationships between variables through visualisations.
